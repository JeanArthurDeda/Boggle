- Test cCItDictionary with u16/u32/u64 instead of char
- ThreadPushPool32bit has unnecessry data spawned across the links - redesign done
- Test ThreadPushPool32bit collision compare with grow size and start size (bias)
- Test with a new character tree dictionary where every leafs contains the word ID (no collision at the cost of memory)
- Could prime factorization help this case?
- transform cCharacterMap to cCharacterTree
